# ToDo App
I used:
`useContext` - for easy state management,
`useMemo`- for memoize expensive functions so that I can avoid calling them on every render
`Custom Hooks`

The project features:
1)Adding todo with tags
2)Editing todo and it's tags
3)Mark as completed or uncompleted
4)Filter by Tags and Clear Filter
5)Storing todos in Localstorage

In the project directory, you need to installing all dependencies:
##### `npm instsall`
You can start the project after installed dependencies
##### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
